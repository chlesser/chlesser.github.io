              Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science Game Design
              at UC Santa Cruz. I specialize in game design and Unity based
              development. Currently, I am a research assistant at the<a href="https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu">Social Emotional Technology Lab</a> where I prototype novel VR interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, if I'm not working on a game or playing one, I run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and play water polo.</p>
            <p>
              I'm currently looking for opportunities in game design and
              development, including internships and contract work. Reach me by
              email or LinkedIn.

              Northern Elephant Seal Migration in VR (2025)

              This project was developed in the SET Lab at UCSC, under the
              direction of PHD student Samir Ghosh and Dr. Katherine Isbister.
              The project was a multi-user VR experience that tracked the
              migration of northern elephant seals around monterey, California.
              It used the THREE.js library, and simulated the seals' movements
              as they slept, ate, and migrated. My primary role on the team was
              developing the time system used in the wildfire evacuation project,
              as this project was based on the previous. I also contributed to the
              graphical design of the paper.

              This project was developed in the SET Lab at UCSC, under the
              direction of PHD student Samir Ghosh and Dr. Katherine Isbister.
              Working with civil engineers at UC Berkeley, we developed a multi-user 
              VR experience to track how people evacuate during a wildfire in Inverness,
              California. It simulates the cars movements, and can show where the bottlenecks
              are in an evacuation. My primary role on the team was developing the timescrubber, ensuring
              that multiple users could interact with the same timeline. I worked on frontend-backend
              communication as well as user interaction, working wtih the THREE.js library.

              collocated movements. We wrote about how these interfaces may
              change for one-to-one, one-to-many, and mutual training circumstances.
              I specifically worked on the ideation and graphic design of the paper.

              For PhysioCHI '24, I worked with Dr. Michael Lankes to develop a prototype
              dodgeball-like game for virtual reality, where closing one's eyes
              created a shield. This was intended to study whether this mechanic
              is viable in virtual reality. It was submitted and accepted to the
              2024 CHI conference as a late-breaking work.

              solid game by the end of its development. This project used
              everything I knew about Unity so far, but I took it one step
              further to make sure that each of the features were coded via C#
              script and in such a way that it is replicable over many different
              maps, enemy types, dungeons, etc.

              Ghili Suit was made in unity for the UCSC 2024 Computational Media
              Game Jam. It's a 2D stealth game, where the player must solve the
              puzzle of each room to take out the target, which were based on
              quotes from various franchises. From this project, I perfected the
              Unity input system, and made an inventory system that could
              dynamically collect items the player found.

              The SET Lab at UCSC required me to learn oculus VR development in
              Unity, as well as the photon multiplayer service. These two
              completely changed how the engine worked, so I had to relearn from
              scratch. This resulted in the very incomplete Islands VR, which
              helped me work with the multiplayer data stream, VR interaction,
              and PunEvents.

              and completely recreated it in Unity. This time, I added more
