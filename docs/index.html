              Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science Game Design
              at UC Santa Cruz. I specialize in game design and Unity based
              development. Currently, I am a research assistant at the <a href="https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu"> Social Emotional Technology Lab</a> where I prototype novel VR interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>In my free time, if I'm not working on a game or playing one, I run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and play water polo.</p>
            <p>
              I'm currently looking for opportunities in game design and
              development, including internships and contract work. Reach me by
              email or LinkedIn.

              This project is developed in the SET Lab at UCSC, under the

              The project is in development as an AR solution to spread climate

              responsible for developing the map, location, data persistance, and leaderboard
              systems, as well as serving as a Unity consultant when recommendation is
              taken. I have also developed several functions for the two minigames.

              This project was developed in the SET Lab at UCSC, under the
              direction of PHD student Samir Ghosh and Dr. Katherine Isbister.
              The project was a multi-user VR experience that tracked the
              migration of northern elephant seals around monterey, California.
              It used the THREE.js library, and simulated the seals' movements
              as they slept, ate, and migrated. My primary role on the team was
              developing the time system used in the wildfire evacuation project,
              as this project was based on the previous. I also contributed to the
              graphical design of the paper.

              Working with civil engineers at UC Berkeley, we developed a multi-user 
              VR experience to track how people evacuate during a wildfire in Inverness,
              California. It simulates the cars movements, and can show where the bottlenecks
              are in an evacuation. My primary role on the team was developing the timescrubber, ensuring
              that multiple users could interact with the same timeline. I worked on frontend-backend
              communication as well as user interaction, working wtih the THREE.js library.

              To Sharpshot or Not to Sharpshot is a tool I created in three days to assist with statistical calculations
              for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. It simulates dice rolls based on user specification and
              outputs whether or not using risky abilities is worth the gamble. It handles a wide variety of abilities
              and probabilities. This tool is implemented in C++ using the DearImgui Library, but I had to learn OpenGL as well.

                Maizecraft was developed in a week using the Phaser library. It is a lighthearted tower defense game
                where a corn farmer must summon heroes and upgrade them with runes to save his corn crops from invading
                orcs. This project heavily utilizes kenney asset packs, featuring voice acting from myself and my teammates.
                I contributed the equation used to govern enemy stats and spawning, almost all logic involving interaction between
                the turrets and the enemies, upgrade integration, resource handling, and much more.

              Arcana is a card-battler that uses tarot cards to play. It was
              originally made for a college project, but ended up as a very
              solid game by the end of its development. This project used
              everything I knew about Unity so far, but I took it one step
              further to make sure that each of the features were coded via C#
              script and in such a way that it is replicable over many different
              maps, enemy types, dungeons, etc.

            <h3>Tavernkeep (2024)</h3>
            <p>
              Tavernkeep is a text-based Twine game originally made for college,
              but evolved into much more. It utilizes an immense amount of
              branches to tell the story of a small business owner in a fantasy
              world, and the challenges that come with it. This project was a
              narrative powerhouse, and helped me refine my creative writing in
              games.

              My tool for learning new systems - I create the next installment
              in this simple series when I want to learn a new system. It
              doubles as a joke and a project-based learning tool where I create
              the same game in different engines. It is also abandoned once I
              feel comfortable with the system, so most are unfinished.

            <h3>Islands VR (2023)</h3>
            <p>
              The SET Lab at UCSC required me to learn oculus VR development in
              Unity, as well as the photon multiplayer service. These two
              completely changed how the engine worked, so I had to relearn from
              scratch. This resulted in the very incomplete Islands VR, which
              helped me work with the multiplayer data stream, VR interaction,
              and PunEvents.

            <p>
              Islands 2 wasn't my first foray into Unity, but it marked the most
              dedicated and complete. I took everything I had made in Islands 1
              and completely recreated it in Unity. This time, I added more
              graphics and animations. As a result, I gained a good
              understanding of Unity as an engine.

            <h3>Islands (2019)</h3>
            <p>
              Islands was created in my freshman year of high school to help
              learn Java for AP CSA. It was a button based clicker, accumilating
              resources to then spend on various things, including going to the
              next island. It helped me master Java, and by extension, C-based languages.
